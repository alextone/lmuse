  \section{Tracks}

      A project contains tracks analog to a conventional tape machine.
      Tracks contain midi- audio- or controller data.
      Tracks are presented in two different ways:

      \blank[big]
      \Input{Arranger:} tracks are displayed in a vertical list
      \Input{Mixer:} the mixer shows track in a horizontal view

      \par\blank[big]

      Tempo and time signature are internal tracks not shown in the
      arranger or mixer.

  \section{Parts}

      Midi- and audio tracks can be divided on the time axis into parts.
