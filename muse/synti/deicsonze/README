DeicsOnze is a virtual synthesizer plugin for MusE which reproduces the
FM synthesis of the YAMAHA DX11 synthesizer/TX81Z sound module.

It contains over 2000 presets archived by Bryan Sutula belonging to the public
domain. If by any chance you find some of them that are under copyright please
contact me to take them off.

Not every function is implemented but it's already sounding like the original
(even better). Pitch envelope, portamento, pitch bend, modulation and some
others are not implemented yet.

The files with the extention .fig in the directory pics have been made 
with xfig.
