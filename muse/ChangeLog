      - MESSS gui interface, first try:
            -every midi instrument can have an associated
             GUI (currently only impl. for MESSS soft synths).
             The GUI is startet as a separate process connected
             to the midi instrument. The gui sends midi commands
             (sysex) to stdout. This midi data stream is connected
             to the midi instrument port.

        different tracks while recording.

            - play
      - fixed: graphic master editor: missing display refresh
        after signature change

        "midi thru" now is associated with a track, if set all input
        to that track is echoet to track port/channel

0.4.5:
      MESSS: (MusE Experimental Software Synthesizer interface Spec):
        A software synthesizer is implemented as a dynamic
        loadable library (*.so file) with two interfaces to the
        outside world:

            - a LADSPA interface for audio output
            - a midi sequencer interface registered to ALSA

      MusE searches all available synths and presents a list
      in Config->SoftSynthesizer. To use a synthesizer you have
      to create an instance. Several instances of an synt can be
      created and used. Every instance creates

        a) an alsa midi sequencer port (look at Config->MidiPorts)
        b) a new strip in the audio mixer

      As a demo i ported a stripped down version of the iiwu
      software synthesizer (http://www.iiwu.org) to MusE.
      Setup info is in README.softsynth
