      - Select Project Dialog:
            - add Toolbar with Functions:
                  - create Subfolder
                  - Folder Up
                  - Folder Down
            - display project subfolder
            - show current project path in QLabel
            - marke projects with different samplerat as current
      - check for samplerate when loading project
      - compute song len in seconds when saving project
      - create dialog to edit project comment

BUGS
	- updating the gui during midi recording is too slow;
        a new, faster implementation is needed

	- dont allow midi editing during recording. Treat recording
        as one undoable action.

      - Do not allow switch track recording on/off during recording

FEATURES
	- wave editor is completely broken

	- list editor

	- missing time signature ruler in master editor

      - If events recorded outside part ask after recording what to do:
         delete events / expand part

	- what to do with events, which start in a part and end outside
        a part (too long to fit entirely in part)
        	- on recording
            - on cut part (split?)

      - recording: punch in/out

	- system info page: show internal statistics about
        - buffer usage (fifo usage)
        - overruns/underruns etc.
        - actual thread state and priorities
        - actual used timer resource

	- export midi

	- Import MusE 0.7 song files

	- NEW function with templates


CLEANUPS
	- Cleanup the icon/pixmap handling using Qt resource file:
      	- rename xpm directory to resources/images
            - remove all unreferenced files
            - transform *.xpm into *.pnm or *.jpg files and move into
              resource file
            - redirect all *xpm program references to resource file
            - remove icon.cpp icon.h

Wishlist
	- it should be possible to show controller events in the
        tracklist for tracktypes which cannot contain
        Parts to make better use of screen real estate.
        GUI-wise a "Add Controller" button is needed.

	- the controller selector in "Add Controller" should be
        implemented as a modal dialog. This allows for
        presenting the list of controller in a more structured
        way.
