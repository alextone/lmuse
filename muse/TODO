      - dont allow for overlapping parts
BUGS
      - make sure all track names are unique

	? updating the gui during midi recording is too slow;
        a new, faster implementation is needed

	- dont allow midi editing during recording. Treat recording
        as one undoable action.

      - Do not allow switch track recording on/off during recording

      ? audio prefetching is not stable

      - looping does not work sample accurate due to jack transport
        limitations; looping should be implemented internally to work
        around this

FEATURES
	- wave editor is completely broken

	- list editor is missing

	- missing time signature ruler in master editor

      - If events recorded outside part ask after recording what to do:
         delete events / expand part

	- what to do with events, which start in a part and end outside
        a part (too long to fit entirely in part)
        	- on recording
            - on cut part (split?)

      - recording: punch in/out

	- system info page: show internal statistics about
        - buffer usage (fifo usage)
        - overruns/underruns etc.
        - actual thread state and priorities
        - actual used timer resource

	- export midi

	- Import MusE 0.7 song files


CLEANUPS
	- Cleanup the icon/pixmap handling using Qt resource file:
      	- rename xpm directory to resources/images
            - remove all unreferenced files
            - transform *.xpm into *.pnm or *.jpg files and move into
              resource file
            - redirect all *xpm program references to resource file
            - remove icon.cpp icon.h

Wishlist
	- it should be possible to show controller events in the
        tracklist for tracktypes which cannot contain
        Parts to make better use of screen real estate.
        GUI-wise a "Add Controller" button is needed.
