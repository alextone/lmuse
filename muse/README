  =============================
      Requirements
  =============================

      - CMake 2.4 
        http:/www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

      - QT: Qt 4.2.0 or above
        ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source
        MusE does _not_ compile with older versions

      - ALSA 1.0 or newer
        http://www.alsa-project.org/

      - gcc 4.x.x

      - libsndfile >= 1.0.1 
        http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/

      - libsamplerate

      - JACK >= 0.103
	  http://jackit.sourceforge.net/download/

      Optional:

      - fluidsynth-1.0.3 (formerly known as iiwusynth) from
        http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/fluid

      - DSSI
      
      - ConTeXt (for building documentation, by default the build
               script tries to build documentation, can be 
               disabled by setting ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION to OFF)

  =============================
      Compiling:
  =============================

      - download source from http://lmuse.sourceforge.net/

      - unpack source:
            tar xvofz muse-xyz.tar.gz </code>

      - to compile MusE, run the following commands:
            mkdir muse                    # create build directory
            cd muse                       # enter build directory
            cmake ../muse-xyz             # create make system
            make                          # compile muse

      - install MusE:
            run "make install"

  =============================
      running MusE
  =============================

      MusE is a realtime program which requires special rights to
      work poperly.
      Recommended setup:

      - check if you are running a sufficiently new linux kernel > 2.6.x

      - create an "audio" group if it does not already exists
        and put yourself into this group

      - make sure you can acces the realtime clock (RTC)
            chmod 660 /dev/rtc
            chgrp audio /dev/rtc

      - make sure MusE cat set the rtc clock:
            echo 8192 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq 
            inspect with:
            cat /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq

      - for MusE to gain RT priviledges load the "realtime-lsm"
        modul; the modul should be configured to give all "audio"
        group members realtime priviledges

      - make sure the alsa sequencer modul is loaded:
            /sbin/modprobe snd-seq
        (same distros (ubuntu) do not load it by default :-( )

      - start qjackctl 
            - start JACK with qjackctl

      - start MusE

      (JACK and all its clients (qjackctl & MusE) must run with the 
      same user id)


  =============================
      known bugs
  =============================

      - many

Let me know whether MusE works for you !!!
Have a look at the webpage http://lmuse.sourceforge.net/ for details.
