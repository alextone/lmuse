This is a quick shot at converting the MusE 1.0 sources to Qt4 using the
Qt3Support compatibility classes. This far it looks quite promising the code
compiles and is runnable. When used it is quickly found that things are not
ok though. Hopefully we can fix most without too much effort

-------
The process this far has involved processing the codebase with the tool
qt3to4 which substitutes many class types for their Qt3Support counterpart and
adds the necessary includes (it missed quite a lot of includes though)

Known issues:

* One .ui file compiles to a nonfunctional .h file, mtrackinfobase.h, this far
I have just commented the errenous line in the .h file (line 400 something)

* Most things that I have touched that didn't feel 100% clear are marked with 
'ddskrjo' so just grep the sources for ddskrjo to find potential issues and
things that are outright commented out.

* configuration of QT4 is hardcoded in configure.am, must be adapted with some 
clever script there is also a hardcoded path to uic3 in common.am.
We need both a way to detect this generically AND a way to use the correct uic
for files that are converted to Qt4 format.

* QTooltip has changed significantly so code that uses this is commented out.

* When launched there are a bunch of errors printed, mostly QPainter that most
likely point to actual problems. As I read in the migration docs previously it
was supported to draw "on" a widget outside the paintEvent this isn't supported
anymore (except with a specific define which we should probably steer clear of)

* Can't open mixer
* Can't open transport
* Pianoroll is nonfunctional
* Drumeditor is nonfunctional (hopefully the same problem)
