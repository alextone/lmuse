      Requirements
  =============================

      - QT: Qt 3.2.0 or above
        ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source
        MusE does _not_ compile with older versions
        Please compile Qt3 with "-thread" option so you get
        the qt-mt.so lib instead of qt.so
        MAKE SURE YOU SET YOUR 'QTDIR' ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE

      - ALSA 0.9.x or newer (cvs)
        http://www.alsa-project.org/

      - gcc 3.x.x
        NOTE: you _must_ compile MusE with the same compiler
                you used to compile QT

      - libsndfile 1.0.1 (current 1.0.4)
        http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/

      - Linux kernel with rtc (RealTimeClock) driver (device /dev/rtc)
        (you may also apply "low latency patches" for low timing jitter)

      - JACK
	  http://jackit.sourceforge.net/download/

      - fluidsynth-1.0.3 (formerly known as iiwusynth) from
        http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/fluid

      - of course: a soundcard and/or some midi gear
      - (if you compile from cvs:) automake 1.7 and autoconf 2.54

  =============================
      Compiling:
  =============================

      - download source from http://lmuse.sourceforge.net/
      - uncompress source:
            bunzip2 muse-x.x.x.tar.bz2
      - untar source:
            tar xvof muse-x.x.x.tar </code>
        or if you have a recent tar, you can combine both steps:
            tar xvofj muse-x.x.x.tar.bz2

      - enter dirctory muse-x.x.x:
            MAKE SURE YOU SET YOUR 'QTDIR' ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
            run configure
            run make all

      - as root run:
            make install
        to install MusE
