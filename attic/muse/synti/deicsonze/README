DeicsOnze is a virtual synthesizer plugin for MusE which reproduces the
FM synthesis of the YAMAHA DX11 synthesizer/TX81Z sound module.

It contains over 2000 presets archived by Bryan Sutula belonging to the public
domain. If by any chance you find some of them that are under copyright please
contact me to take it off as soon as possible.

Not every function is implemented but it starts to sound like the original
(and even better). Pitch envelope, portamento, pitch bend, modulation and some
others are not implemented yet.

The vertical sliders are inverted because QTDesigner doesn't have the feature
of slider invertion, since I think that it will get it before I will finish
DeicsOnze I'm waiting for a QT improvement.
